The run_analysis.r script is used to transform raw data collected from the accelerometers from the Samsung Galaxy S smartphone, 
into two tidy data-sets. 

1.Data that for every observation has features on the mean and std_deviation, and a feature that denotes the activity the subject was performing. 

2.Data with the average value for the features on the mean and std_deviation, for every subject, and every activity. 

A description of the steps, transformations, and features that we choose can be found in CodeBook.md
